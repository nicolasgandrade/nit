# Nit

Nit is a _very_ simplified re-implementation of Git in Elixir.

The project serves as a deep dive into two distinct worlds:

Git Internals: Understanding the "plumbing" — how Git manages objects (blobs, trees, commits), calculates hashes, and navigates history.

The Elixir Ecosystem: Applying functional programming patterns, recursion, and pattern matching to handle complex file-system operations and binary data.
